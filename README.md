## First and Second Level fMRI Models for Resting-State Functional Connectivity

This repository contains example Python scripts and SLURM job submission files for performing first- and second-level fMRI analyses. The modeling is designed for resting-state functional connectivity analysis and is intended to be used on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

## üß† First-Level Analysis
Each subject's resting-state time series is modeled using one or more ROI masks provided as .nii or .nii.gz files. For each ROI, the script extracts the average timeseries and fits a GLM to estimate voxelwise beta coefficients across the brain. The output includes:
- A beta image for each ROI, per subject (reflecting voxelwise connectivity).
- The extracted timeseries for each ROI

## üß† Second-Level Analysis
This step uses Nilearn‚Äôs SecondLevelModel to combine individual subjects‚Äô whole brain beta images for the ROI used in the first level model. It creates a group-level z-map showing resting state functional connectivity.
